# Data Science Portfolio  

Hi! My name is Adithya Kumar, and I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto, where I completed a **Double Major in Mathematics and Economics** with a **Minor in Statistics**. With a strong academic foundation and a passion for Mathematics and Statistics, I am committed to leveraging data science to uncover meaningful insights and solve complex problems.  

## About This Portfolio  
This portfolio is a curated collection of my work in data science, demonstrating my skills and expertise in:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Machine Learning** 
- **Data Visualization** 
- **Statistical and Econometric Analysis** 

## Technical Proficiencies  
- **Programming Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy), R, Stata  
- **Data Management:** SQL, Excel.  
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Power BI, MicroStrategy  
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Regression(Linear, Lasso, Ridge), Logistic Regression, K-nn Regression,  Decision Trees & Forests, Boosted Trees(AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost) K-Means clustering, Hierarchical clustering.

# Contents
- **Predicting Movie Rental Durations:** Here I utilized several different supervised learning techniques to accurately predict the duration a movie is rented. This showcases my knowledge of data pre-processing, model selection, and hyper-parameter tuning. 
- **Clustering Penguin Species:** Here unsupervised learning clustering techniques were used on Penguin's data, to seperate them into their different species. Qualitative techniques were used to identify the correct number of clusters/species.
